````bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
````
Install dependencies:
````bash
npm install
````

The compress task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.
````bash
npm run zip
````

## AI Agent Skills

Repo-local Codex skills live in `.codex/skills/`, and `AGENTS.md` points general-purpose AI agents to the right skill before they edit the theme.

* `readwise-ghost-theme-design-system` guides visual, typography, layout, color, responsive, and component-level theme changes.
* `readwise-ghost-theme-packaging` guides ZIP generation, release artifact handling, and CI packaging changes.

After a pull request is merged to `master`, GitHub Actions builds the theme and uploads `dist/atilla-rw-custom.zip` as a workflow artifact. The ZIP is intentionally not committed to git.
